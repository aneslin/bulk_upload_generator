# Hyrax Bulk Upload Generator

This is a work in progress.  The goal is to create a gem that contains a Rails Generator that can add an MVC component to the Hyrax framework that supports the bulk upload/creation of multiple ActiveFedora objects.

It currently works in a test app, but extracting it into a testable external component as a gem will be an interesting problem.
